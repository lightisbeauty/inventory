## Privacy

Everything runs locally. No data is transmitted, collected, or shared.

## Install

1. Download `inventory.dmg` from the [latest release](https://github.com/lightisbeauty/inventory/releases/latest)
2. Open the DMG, drag `inventory.app` to Applications
3. Double-click to run

On first launch, inventory will offer to install Homebrew and `mas` if they aren't present — both are needed for the full Mac App Store inventory. All other package manager sections appear automatically if the tool is already installed on your system, and are hidden if not.

## Export

Reports can be exported as **PDF** (all sections expanded, via native save dialog) or **HTML** (self-contained file, viewable in any browser).

## Requirements

- macOS 12 or later
- Python 3 (included with Xcode Command Line Tools)
- Homebrew + `mas` — optional, installed on first run if you choose

## Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lightisbeauty/inventory.git
cd inventory
bash build_dmg.sh
```

Requires Xcode Command Line Tools for `swiftc` and Homebrew's `create-dmg`.
