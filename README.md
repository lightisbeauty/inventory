- Mac App Store — app names, versions, and App Store IDs
- MacPorts
- Fink
- Nix
- Python packages (pip)
- Node.js global packages (npm)
- Ruby gems (with repo links and descriptions)
- Rust binaries (cargo)
- Conda / Mamba environments

**System & Background Software**
- Launch Agents — User (`~/Library/LaunchAgents`)

## Privacy

Everything runs locally. No data is transmitted, collected, or shared.

## Install

1. Download `inventory.dmg` from the [latest release](https://github.com/lightisbeauty/inventory/releases/latest)
2. Open the DMG, drag `inventory.app` to Applications
3. Double-click to run

On first launch, inventory will offer to install Homebrew and `mas` if they aren't present — both are needed for the full Mac App Store inventory. All other package manager sections appear automatically if the tool is already installed on your system, and are hidden if not.

## Snapshots & Compare

Click **Save Snapshot** to save the current report to your snapshot library (`~/Library/Application Support/inventory/snapshots/`). Snapshots are named automatically with the date, time, and serial number.

Click **Compare** to open the snapshot picker — a list of all saved snapshots sorted newest first. Select one to diff it against the current scan. inventory shows a section-by-section breakdown of what was added, removed, or updated, including macOS version and hardware changes. Each section card is collapsible; System always appears first.

To remove old snapshots, hit **Delete** next to any entry in the picker. If you need to compare against an HTML file from outside the snapshot library, use **Compare from file…** at the bottom of the picker.

## Export

Reports can also be exported as **PDF** (all sections expanded, via native save dialog) or **HTML** (self-contained file, viewable in any browser).

## Requirements

- macOS 12 or later
- Python 3 (included with Xcode Command Line Tools)
- Homebrew + `mas` — optional, installed on first run if you choose

## Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lightisbeauty/inventory.git
cd inventory
bash build_dmg.sh
```

Requires Xcode Command Line Tools for `swiftc` and Homebrew's `create-dmg`.
